## Overview

[PhishBait](https://github.com/luckalgorithm/PhishBait) is a demonstration that simulates how a phishing attack might capture sensitive information like email and password through a spoofed form. It uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io) to simulate data capture and redirection, showing how attackers can disguise malicious pages to look legitimate.

See [Demo](https://luckalgorithm.github.io/PhishBait/TackleBox/Demo/demo.html) for more information.
