## Overview

PhishBait is a demonstration that simulates how a phishing attack might capture sensitive information like email and password through a spoofed form. It uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io) to simulate data capture and redirection, showcasing how attackers often disguise malicious pages to look legitimate.

Use this for illegal purposes and you might end up explaining your "cool little project" to a judge who doesnâ€™t appreciate HTML, and get free government-sponsored housing. Don't do anything stupid.
