PhishBait's CLI makes it easy to preview phishing sites locally using system commands. All of the phishing files are located in the [TackleBox](../TackleBox/) directory. Just run [build.sh](../build.sh) with `./build.sh` to build and execute.

you may need to give the shell script write permission at first. For Unix systems, run `chmod +x shell.sh`.
